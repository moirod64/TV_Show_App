Hi,

This is a very simple app created as a test. Simple search for TV Shows pulled from tvmaze API.

Mostly done to brainstorm some knowledge acquireded on these frameworks and work on how to pull and display data utilizing EJS.

Works on Node, so might want to go ahead and start the app from the terminal either using live-server or from Windows terminal using "node app.js"(nodemon, if installed).

Dependencies are Axios, Express and EJS-Mate. Just do a simple npm -i for that.
